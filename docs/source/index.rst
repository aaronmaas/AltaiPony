======================================================
Find and analyse flares in K2 light curves
======================================================

**AltaiPony** replaces the original Appaloosa_. **AltaiPony** finds flares in Kepler and K2 photometry. It is optimised to work with K2SC de-trended light curves but fetches ``KeplerTargetPixelFiles`` for ancillary data or if you want to remove systematic and periodic variability (vulgo *de-trending*) yourself. You can use most functionalities from lightkurve_'s ``KeplerLightCurve`` class. **AltaiPony** also runs **k2sc** for de-trending and flare characterization. Shortcut to the core class  here_.

Problems?
^^^^^^^^^

 Often, when something does not work in **AltaiPony** and this documentation is useless, troubleshooting can be done by diving into the extensive **lightkurve** docs_. Otherwise, you can always shoot Ekaterina an email_ or open an issue on GitHub_. Many foreseeable problems will be due to **AltaiPony** itself.
